	Update buildRelease.bat, to reflect proper 
	case of folder name "Gamedata" is actually GameData 
	on Linux. Windows will ignore the case but as it was, 
	this mod's content was ending up in Gamedata/ whereas 
	all other mods existed in GameData/ and therefore the 
	mod was not being loaded., Thank you Paul Smith

	Bring back engine fairings post 1.0.5
	The stock ModuleJettison now supports toggling the fairings, 
	so there's no reason to have this anymore.  Thank you blowfishpro

Date:   Fri Dec 4 22:19:22 2015 -0800
	Adjust ModuleTestSubject
	The Titan T1 is definitely a lower stage engine, 
	and the Titan V is more of an upper stage.  Thank you blowfishpro

	Fixed release script to clear out old directory 
	before doing install/release build.  Old directory 
	had an old file which was causing problems

Date:   Fri Jan 22 15:39:09 2016 -0500
	Add ModuleManager Patch to create new parts
	Add Community Parts Patch, thank you blackleg

0.4.5	When B9 AeroSpace is installed and CommunityTechTree is not, 
	the node "Experimental Rocketry", where the last engines of 
	both mods sit, is duplicated at the same position.

	This fix handles this situation by preventing any action from 
	KW Community Patch but still adding the requirement to unlock 
	the "High Performance Fuel System" node.
	Added MiniAVC.dll

0.4.6	Fix Force direction in KW3mPetalAdapter, thank you blackleg
	Reformatted the CHANGES.txt to put in date order
